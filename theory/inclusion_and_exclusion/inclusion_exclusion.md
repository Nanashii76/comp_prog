# Principles of Inclusion and Exclusion

-> Set Theory

Set is a form to store elements that doesn't repeat
Generally sets're sorted

'''
{AuB} = A + B - {A^B} -> union of the sets

-> Generalised function

Discovering the pattern of even and odd sets
Let's see if we've 3 sets

|AuBuC| ->  A + B + C
          - |AB| - |AC| - |BC|
          + |ABC|

Now let's see for 4 sets

|AuBuCuD| ->  A + B + C + D
             - |AB| - |AC| - |BC|
             + |ABC| + |ABD| + |BCD| + |ACD|
             - |ABCD|
