# What're Big Integers?

'''
    Big integers're numbers larger than 10^18, so we can't
    store then in just one variable
    in that case we store then in two array or two strings

    Now the question is, how to do some arithmetics with
    two string or arrays?

Addition
'''
    Create a algorithm that matches the pen and paper operation

    Ex: N1 = 938, N2 = 65

        1 1  
        9 3 8
       +  6 5
    ------------
      1 0 0 3

    In that case we can put then in 2 arrays and sum, assuming that
    the value of b is aways the greater

    the sum of the array will be with the reverse of each number, because the array just can expand to the right

    so the final answer've to be reversed
